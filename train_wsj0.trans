012c0212 AND IN A VOLATILE UNCERTAIN MARKET LIKE THIS INVESTORS USE LIMIT ORDERS TO TRY TO MAKE SHORT TERM GAINS

019c0204 IT ALSO INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF DEFECTIONS FROM HILL SAMUEL'S ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MEMBER CORPORATE FINANCE GROUP ACCORDING TO INSIDERS AND OFFICIALS OF OTHER BANKS
019c0205 AS PART OF T. S. B. THE DEPARTMENT MAINLY WOULD SERVE SMALL COMPANIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
019c0206 MANY MEMBERS OF THE TEAM HAD SOUGHT AN ALLIANCE WITH A LARGER GLOBAL PARTNER
019c0207 UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE THEY HAD THOUGHT THE OPERATION WOULD BE SOLD TO BARCLAYS BANK P. L. C.
019c0208 EVEN BEFORE BLACK MONDAY RETAILERS WERE NERVOUS ABOUT THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON
019c0209 STORE SALES HAD BEEN SOFT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AMID SIGNS THAT THE CONSUMER LED ECONOMIC EXPANSION WAS FALTERING
019c020a THE DOLLAR'S DECLINE HADN'T HELPED EITHER AS RETAILERS WHO DEPEND ON GOODS FROM THE FAR EAST HAD TO ABSORB HIGHER COSTS
019c020b CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN INHERITED FROM HIS PREDECESSOR PAUL VOLCKER A MONETARY POLICY THAT HAD BEEN QUITE ERRATIC
019c020c THE FED ALLOWED THE MONEY SUPPLY TO GROW VERY RAPIDLY THROUGH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
019c020d THEN IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE CENTRAL BANK TIGHTENED UP SHARPLY
019c020e FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THIS YEAR I THOUGHT POLICY MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT SAYS MILTON FRIEDMAN OF THE HOOVER INSTITUTION
019c020f YOU COULD SAY THAT IT WAS OFFSETTING THE EXCESSIVELY EASY POLICY OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
019c020g BUT THE RESTRAINT CONTINUED AND IN EARLY OCTOBER BEFORE THE MARKET CRASH MR. FRIEDMAN PREDICTED A RECESSION WOULD START IN SIX TO NINE MONTHS
019c020h LAST MARCH DISASTER STRUCK
019c020i THE PLANTS WILTED AND DIED
019c020j THE CALGARY COMPLEX WAS ON THE SITE OF A DISMANTLED OIL REFINERY AND MR. SPRUNG SAYS CONTAMINANTS FROM THE GROUND KILLED THE PLANTS
019c020k THE PLACE ALMOST BLEW UP WITH THE GASOLINE COMING IN FROM OUTSIDE HE SAYS
019c020l IT'S PRETTY REASONABLE FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE A DIVE ON THIS ONE HE SAYS
019c020m I'M A LITTLE SCARED
019c020n I DON'T BLAME PEOPLE FOR NOT BEING HEROES
019c020o BOTH STAPLES AND OFFICE CLUB HOPE TO BE ABLE TO GO PUBLIC NEXT YEAR
019c020p THEY AREN'T AFRAID OF LARGE DISCOUNTERS SUCH AS K. MART AND AMES
019c020q MR. PEARLMAN THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER SAYS HISTORY HASN'T SHOWN THAT BIG RETAILERS HAVE BEEN GOOD AT SPECIALTY RETAILING
019c020r OTHER LARGE AND MIDSIZED CARS POSTING GOOD SCORES WERE THE MERCURY SABLE THE OLDSMOBILE DELTA EIGHTY EIGHT AND THE BUICK REGAL
019c020s THREE CARS IN THE CATEGORY PERFORMED POORLY POSTING SCORES ABOVE ONE THOUSAND FOR THE DRIVER'S SIDE
019c020t THEY WERE THE BUICK PARK AVENUE THE CHRYSLER NEW YORKER AND THE RENAULT MEDALLION
019c020u ALL THE CARS TESTED WERE FOUR DOOR VEHICLES EXCEPT THE BUICK
019c020v ESTIMATES OF THE MAKEUP OF THE FEEDLOT POPULATION VARY WIDELY
019c020w MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO REPORT THAT THE NUMBER OF YOUNG CATTLE PLACED ON FEEDLOTS FELL IN JULY FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH FROM A YEAR EARLIER
019c020x HOWEVER SOME EXPECT A RISE
019c020y NOT ALL BLACK COLLEGES ARE ON THE ROPES
019c020z IN FACT A NUMBER OF ELITE INSTITUTIONS ARE THRIVING IN PART BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL FUND RAISING EFFORTS
019c0210 LAST WEEK FOR INSTANCE MR. COSBY AND HIS WIFE CAMILLE DONATED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SPELMAN COLLEGE A BLACK WOMEN'S COLLEGE IN ATLANTA
019c0211 THAT LEAVES THE OPTION OF A MILITARY STRIKE AT TERRORISTS OR THEIR BASES WHICH ARE MAINLY IN LEBANON'S BEKAA VALLEY AN AREA UNDER SYRIAN CONTROL
019c0212 U. S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE IDENTIFIED AS POTENTIAL TARGETS THERE BUILDINGS KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN USED BY HEZBOLLAH FORCES AND THEIR MENTORS THE IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS
019c0213 BUT THEY AREN'T CERTAIN WHICH FACTIONS USE WHICH BUILDINGS OR WHEN THEY ARE PRESENT
019c0214 NATIONAL ADVERTISERS HAILING FROM AS FAR EAST AS NEW YORK ARE INDEED STARTING TO DISCOVER THE OTHER COAST OR AT LEAST A FEW SELECT AGENCIES HERE
019c0215 CREATIVE HOT SHOPS LIKE LOS ANGELES'S CHIAT SLASH DAY AND SAN FRANCISCO'S HAL RINEY AND PARTNERS CAUGHT THE OUTSIDERS' EYES FIRST
019c0216 BUT LATELY WESTERN OUTPOSTS OF A FEW OLD LINE AGENCIES LIKE CHICAGO BASED FOOTE CONE ARE STARTING TO BECOME NATIONAL ADVERTISING POWERS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT
019c0217 I WAS ENVIOUS OF MY TEAM'S SNATCHER A TALL SKINNY NURSE UNTIL I SAW WHAT SHE HAD TO ENDURE IN THE NAME OF ESPRIT DE CORPS
019c0218 HER LONG LEGS WERE STRETCHED WIDE AND BOUND WITH RIBBONS TO THE HORNS OF THE DRAGON'S HEAD
019c0219 HER TORSO WAS TAUT WITH TENSION LEANING OUT BEYOND THE BUMPY DRAGON'S HEAD UPON WHICH SHE RESTED HER STOMACH
019c021a MR. BROOKS'S ARTICLE AWAKENED MEMORIES OF MY TIME AS MR. HOOK'S STUDENT AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY'S WASHINGTON SQUARE COLLEGE SOME TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AGO
019c021b ONE OF MR. HOOK'S MOST REMARKABLE PARABLES STILL STAYS FRESH IN MY MIND
019c021c HE TOLD OF AN OLD MAN DYING IN THE SPRINGTIME WHO CALLED HIS SONS TO HIS BEDSIDE
019c021d MY TREASURE HE SAID IS BURIED SOMEWHERE ON THIS FARM
019c021e YOU HAVE ONLY TO DIG TO FIND IT
019c021f HE DIED AND THE SONS WENT FOR THEIR SHOVELS
019c021g SURE ENOUGH THAT AUTUMN THEY FOUND AND SHARED THE TREASURE
019c021h THIS WAS SIDNEY HOOK'S PARALLEL FOR THE ADVANTAGES OF DEMOCRACY

01ac0206 INDEED SHE HAS NO PERSONAL DEVOTION TO THESE CAUSES THEY ARE SIMPLY VEHICLES FOR HER PROFESSIONAL SKILLS

01ac020b ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO SOUTHLAND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS CONSIDERING RESTRUCTURING ALTERNATIVES BUT WOULDN'T ELABORATE
01ac020c THE OWNER AND OPERATOR OF EIGHT THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SEVEN ELEVEN STORES REPEATEDLY HAS SAID IT DIDN'T KNOW OF REASONS FOR THE HEAVY TRADING IN ITS STOCK
01ac020d BUT STOCK TRADERS CONTINUED TO EXPECT SOUTHLAND TO TAKE SOME ACTION EVEN WHILE SEVERAL ANALYSTS AND INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES SAID THEY BELIEVED SOUTHLAND WOULDN'T RESPOND UNLESS A HOSTILE BIDDER EMERGED

01ac020n NEITHER SIDE ELABORATED

01ac020x IT WAS NEVER ABLE TO COME UP WITH A FAIRNESS OPINION ON THE ORIGINAL OFFER
01ac020y IT SAID IT COULDN'T RECOMMEND WHETHER THE COMPANY SHOULD BE SOLD AT THAT TIME OR AT WHAT PRICE
01ac020z YESTERDAY CHARTER SAID ITS SPECIAL BOARD COMMITTEE HAD INFORMED THE GROUP THAT IT HASN'T DETERMINED WHETHER IT IS APPROPRIATE TO SELL THE COMPANY NOW EITHER
01ac0210 THE REVISED OFFER IS SUBJECT TO THE COMMITTEE'S DETERMINING THAT THE PRICE IS FAIR AMONG OTHER CONDITIONS
01ac0211 MERITOR HAS ALSO JOINED THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK SYSTEM LAST MONTH
01ac0212 IT CAN BORROW INTERMEDIATE TERM FUNDS FROM THE BANK SYSTEM WHICH WOULD ALLOW MERITOR TO MORE CLOSELY MATCH ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

01ac021c BANKS WOULD HAVE A NEW PRODUCT AT THE I. M. F. WHERE THEY COULD PEDDLE UNWANTED DEBTOR NATION PAPER
01ac021d THE DEBTOR NATIONS WOULD HAVE A NEW SOURCE OF FINANCING OF SORTS
01ac021e THEY COULD RESCHEDULE A PORTION OF THEIR DEBTS WITH A POSSIBILITY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OF REPAYING SOME OF THEIR OWN CURRENCIES
01ac021f THE I. M. F. WOULD HAVE A MORE CENTRAL ROLE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL DEBT

01mc0215 IN BRITAIN DIRECTORS' LEGAL DUTY IS TO SHAREHOLDERS DUTCH LAW OBLIGATES DIRECTORS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY'S INTEREST INCLUDING EMPLOYEES CUSTOMERS AND CREDITORS
01mc0216 DUTCH LAW IS SO HOSTILE TO UNFRIENDLY BIDS THAT NONE HAS SUCCEEDED THERE SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY
01mc0217 SO SO
01mc0218 THAT MAKES THE PROBLEM A LITTLE HARDER
01mc0219 LET ME THINK FOR A MINUTE
01mc021a WHEN THE HOUSE AND SENATE APPROVED THE TAX BILL EARLY SATURDAY LAWMAKERS DIDN'T MENTION THE LAST MINUTE PROVISIONS AND CONGRESSIONAL STAFFERS DESCRIBED THEM AS TECHNICAL
01mc021b WHILE THE ESTIMATED REVENUE OF ALMOST ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS IS RELATIVELY SMALL THE PROVISIONS MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS AN ANTI TAKEOVER PUSH BY CONGRESS

01tc020n BOND TRADERS ALSO WERE CHEERED BY ANOTHER DROP IN OIL FUTURES PRICES THE SEVENTH DECLINE IN THE PAST EIGHT SESSIONS

01tc0216 ECONOMISTS ARE CURRENTLY FOCUSING ON THE INDEX TO GET A READING ON WAGE INFLATION
01tc0217 THE LABOR DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO REPORT MONTHLY AGGREGATE DATA ON AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS
01tc0218 BUT THE INDEX IS BEING REPLACED BY THE EMPLOYMENT COST SERIES
01tc0219 ECONOMISTS SAID THE NEW INDEX HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING A MORE RELIABLE READING AND THE DISADVANTAGE OF COMING OUT ONLY ONCE A QUARTER RATHER THAN EVERY MONTH
01tc021a HIGHER COMMISSIONS CAN ALSO REDUCE THE INVESTMENT VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES THAT INCLUDE A SAVINGS COMPONENT SUCH AS UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICIES
01tc021b IN GENERAL POLICIES WITH HIGHER COMMISSIONS HAVE LOWER SURRENDER VALUES

025c020a IT DOESN'T INCLUDE GREYHOUND LINES OF CANADA A UNIT BASED IN CALGARY ALBERTA

025c020c THERE AREN'T MANY SELLERS AROUND ONE BROKER SAID

025c020e SEVERAL MARKET MAKERS WERE SAID TO HAVE BEEN EXPECTING THE RISE ON WALL STREET TO END AND HAD CONSEQUENTLY BEEN HOPING TO SELL SHARES IN LONDON
025c020f MONDAY'S SHARP GAIN ON THE NEW YORK EXCHANGE AND TUESDAY'S HIGHER OPENING THERE CAUGHT THEM OFF GUARD
025c020g TELEPORT SAID THAT ABOUT A YEAR AGO IT ASKED NEW YORK TELEPHONE TO ALLOW IT TO PLACE THE EQUIPMENT IN THE CENTRAL OFFICE

025c0214 THE DECLINE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX RESULTS REFLECTS THE RECORDING OF DEFERRED TAXES RELATED TO CHEVRON'S NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR ACQUISITION OF GULF CORPORATION AMONG OTHER THINGS
025c0215 LIKEWISE THE INCREASE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN NET LARGELY IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE REDUCTION IN DEFERRED TAX EXPENSES RELATED TO THE PURCHASE CHEVRON SAID
025c0216 THE COMPANY NOTED THAT NONE OF THE ACCOUNTING CHANGES AFFECTS ITS LIQUIDITY OR OPERATING PLANS
025c0217 N. E. C. CORPORATION AS ONE EXAMPLE BEGAN DONATING MONEY TO M. I. T. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES

025c021a MISS ROBBINS WAS ON VACATION AND COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT
025c021b MICHAEL SCHWARTZ A PARTNER AT WACHTELL LIPTON SAID THIS IS AN UNFORTUNATE OUTCOME FROM THE FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE UNIFORM PRACTICE OF STAMPING DOCUMENTS CONFIDENTIAL
025c021c IT WAS INADVERTENT
025c021d BUT EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT ONCE AN UPSCALE PRODUCT PUTS ITS NAME ON LOWER PRICED GOODS IT CAN NEVER GO BACK UP
025c021e REVLON GROUP INCORPORATED FOR EXAMPLE IS MAKING A LONG SHOT ATTEMPT TO REKINDLE THE HALSTON FLAME
025c021f REVLON OWNER OF HALSTON ENTERPRISES INCORPORATED HAS VISIONS OF SEEING HALSTON LABEL CLOTHES BACK IN BETTER DRESS DEPARTMENTS

026c020j TRANSAMERICAN FILED FOR COURT PROTECTION FROM CREDITORS IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHEN IT WAS MIRED IN ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF DEBT
026c020k IN TAMPA A JIM WALTER SPOKESMAN WOULDN'T DISCUSS THE MATTER
026c020l PEOPLE CAN SAY WHAT THEY WANT BUT WE WON'T COMMENT HE SAID
026c020m MR. WALTER HIMSELF AND OTHER TOP EXECUTIVES DIDN'T RETURN PHONE CALLS
026c020n MR. TRUMP WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT YESTERDAY
026c020o INDUSTRY SOURCES HAVE DISPUTED HIS CLAIM THAT HE HOLDS THAT LARGE A GOLDEN NUGGET STAKE AS WELL AS ANY TAKEOVER THREAT
026c020p STEPHEN A. WYNN GOLDEN NUGGET'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER HAS DENIED THAT THE BUY BACK IS DEFENSIVE
026c020q HE WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT YESTERDAY

026c020s BUT THERE'S ALSO A TREND HERE
026c020t EATING TRENDS HAVE CHANGED AND WE FIND THERE IS GREATER ACCEPTANCE OF COLD MEALS
026c020u I FIND LITTLE EVIDENCE OF THE WIDESPREAD PESSIMISM YOU SAY ABOUNDS ON THE NATION'S FARMS
026c020v IN FACT THE FARM CRISIS NOW EASING HAS TAUGHT OUR FOOD AND FIBER GROWERS TO BE TOUGHER BUSINESSMEN MORE COST CONSCIOUS AND BETTER PLANNERS
026c020w MANY ALREADY ANTICIPATE A DECREASE IN FEDERAL FARM SUBSIDIES AND ARE FINE TUNING THEIR OPERATIONS TO BE PROFITABLE WITHOUT THEM
026c020x THEY SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR THESE EFFORTS
026c020y FEDERAL POLICY MAKERS WRESTLING WITH BUDGET DEFICITS HAVE MUCH TO LEARN FROM THEM
026c020z IT WAS LEFT TO MODERATOR JAMES P. GANNON EDITOR OF THE DES MOINES REGISTER WHICH SPONSORED THE DEBATE TO BRING UP MR. HART'S INFIDELITY
026c0210 MR. GANNON REMINDED MR. HART HE HAD TOLD EDITORS OF THE REGISTER THAT IF HE IS ELECTED HE WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST ADULTERER IN THE WHITE HOUSE
026c0211 MR. GANNON ASKED SHOULD VOTERS IN IOWA IGNORE THESE QUESTIONS OF CHARACTER AND JUDGMENT
026c0212 THE CUOMO PLAN DOESN'T STOP AT GOUGING NEW YORK TAXPAYERS AND LONG ISLAND RATEPAYERS
026c0213 FEDERAL TAXPAYERS ALSO WILL CONTRIBUTE
026c0214 THE KEY TO THE DEAL IS THAT LILCO ALSO WOULD GET A TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR TAX WRITE OFF FOR SHOREHAM
026c0215 THIS WOULD GUARANTEE THAT THE UTILITY WON'T HAVE TO PAY ANY FEDERAL TAXES FOR AT LEAST A DECADE
026c0216 NEW YORK ALSO WOULD HELP LILCO FLOAT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX EXEMPT INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BONDS TO HELP PAY FOR THE CLEANUP
026c0217 MAKE THAT DE INDUSTRIALIZATION BONDS
026c0218 THE WASHINGTON BASED RALES GROUP FIRST MADE A MERGER PROPOSAL FOR INTERCO AT SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS IN LATE JULY
026c0219 INTERCO WHICH MAKES CONVERSE ATHLETIC SHOES LONDON FOG RAIN GEAR AND ETHAN ALLEN FURNITURE REJECTED THE OFFER AND PUSHED ITS OWN REORGANIZATION AND RECAPITALIZATION PLAN
026c021a THE RALES BROTHERS LAUNCHED THEIR HOSTILE TENDER OFFER IN MID AUGUST
026c021b DURING THE SPRING AND SUMMER THE FED NUDGED UP SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES TO RESTRAIN THE ECONOMY
026c021c BUT WORRIED AS ALWAYS ABOUT BECOMING A POLITICAL FOOTBALL THE FED TRIED TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE IN THE WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION
026c021d THAT STRATEGY WAS HELPED BY AN APPARENT SLOWDOWN IN ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE THIRD QUARTER WHICH EASED INFLATION WORRIES AND ALLOWED THE FED TO STOP PUSHING UP RATES

027c0201 U. S. BANKS IN JAPAN CURRENTLY CAN TRADE IN SOME SECURITIES BUT ARE BASICALLY CONFINED TO DEALING WITH THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY LARGEST JAPANESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
027c0202 THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH EITHER RETAIL CUSTOMERS OR CORPORATIONS
027c0203 THEY CAN UNDERWRITE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BONDS BUT THE SHARE OF SUCH BUSINESS REMAINS VERY SMALL
027c0204 IT ALSO INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF DEFECTIONS FROM HILL SAMUEL'S ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MEMBER CORPORATE FINANCE GROUP ACCORDING TO INSIDERS AND OFFICIALS OF OTHER BANKS
027c0205 AS PART OF T. S. B. THE DEPARTMENT MAINLY WOULD SERVE SMALL COMPANIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM

027c020a THE DOLLAR'S DECLINE HADN'T HELPED EITHER AS RETAILERS WHO DEPEND ON GOODS FROM THE FAR EAST HAD TO ABSORB HIGHER COSTS
027c020b CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN INHERITED FROM HIS PREDECESSOR PAUL VOLCKER A MONETARY POLICY THAT HAD BEEN QUITE ERRATIC
027c020c THE FED ALLOWED THE MONEY SUPPLY TO GROW VERY RAPIDLY THROUGH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
027c020d THEN IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE CENTRAL BANK TIGHTENED UP SHARPLY
027c020e FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THIS YEAR I THOUGHT POLICY MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT SAYS MILTON FRIEDMAN OF THE HOOVER INSTITUTION
027c020f YOU COULD SAY THAT IT WAS OFFSETTING THE EXCESSIVELY EASY POLICY OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
027c020g BUT THE RESTRAINT CONTINUED AND IN EARLY OCTOBER BEFORE THE MARKET CRASH MR. FRIEDMAN PREDICTED A RECESSION WOULD START IN SIX TO NINE MONTHS
027c020h LAST MARCH DISASTER STRUCK

027c020y NOT ALL BLACK COLLEGES ARE ON THE ROPES
027c020z IN FACT A NUMBER OF ELITE INSTITUTIONS ARE THRIVING IN PART BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL FUND RAISING EFFORTS
027c0210 LAST WEEK FOR INSTANCE MR. COSBY AND HIS WIFE CAMILLE DONATED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SPELMAN COLLEGE A BLACK WOMEN'S COLLEGE IN ATLANTA
027c0211 THAT LEAVES THE OPTION OF A MILITARY STRIKE AT TERRORISTS OR THEIR BASES WHICH ARE MAINLY IN LEBANON'S BEKAA VALLEY AN AREA UNDER SYRIAN CONTROL
027c0212 U. S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE IDENTIFIED AS POTENTIAL TARGETS THERE BUILDINGS KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN USED BY HEZBOLLAH FORCES AND THEIR MENTORS THE IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS
027c0213 BUT THEY AREN'T CERTAIN WHICH FACTIONS USE WHICH BUILDINGS OR WHEN THEY ARE PRESENT
027c0214 NATIONAL ADVERTISERS HAILING FROM AS FAR EAST AS NEW YORK ARE INDEED STARTING TO DISCOVER THE OTHER COAST OR AT LEAST A FEW SELECT AGENCIES HERE
027c0215 CREATIVE HOT SHOPS LIKE LOS ANGELES'S CHIAT SLASH DAY AND SAN FRANCISCO'S HAL RINEY AND PARTNERS CAUGHT THE OUTSIDERS' EYES FIRST
027c0216 BUT LATELY WESTERN OUTPOSTS OF A FEW OLD LINE AGENCIES LIKE CHICAGO BASED FOOTE CONE ARE STARTING TO BECOME NATIONAL ADVERTISING POWERS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT
027c0217 I WAS ENVIOUS OF MY TEAM'S SNATCHER A TALL SKINNY NURSE UNTIL I SAW WHAT SHE HAD TO ENDURE IN THE NAME OF ESPRIT DE CORPS
027c0218 HER LONG LEGS WERE STRETCHED WIDE AND BOUND WITH RIBBONS TO THE HORNS OF THE DRAGON'S HEAD
027c0219 HER TORSO WAS TAUT WITH TENSION LEANING OUT BEYOND THE DUMPY DRAGON'S HEAD UPON WHICH SHE RESTED HER STOMACH
027c021a MR. BROOKS'S ARTICLE AWAKENED MEMORIES OF MY TIME AS MR. HOOK'S STUDENT AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY'S WASHINGTON SQUARE COLLEGE SOME TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AGO
027c021b ONE OF MR. HOOK'S MOST REMARKABLE PARABLES STILL STAYS FRESH IN MY MIND
027c021c HE TOLD OF AN OLD MAN DYING IN THE SPRINGTIME WHO CALLED HIS SONS TO HIS BEDSIDE
027c021d MY TREASURE HE SAID IS BURIED SOMEWHERE ON THIS FARM
027c021e YOU HAVE ONLY TO DIG TO FIND IT
027c021f HE DIED AND THE SONS WENT FOR THEIR SHOVELS
027c021g SURE ENOUGH THAT AUTUMN THEY FOUND AND SHARED THE TREASURE

028c0212 UNLIKE THE OLD DAYS THE ENSUING SCRAMBLE FOR CASH WOULD HAVE FOCUSED ON SECURITIES FIRMS RATHER THAN THE BANKING SYSTEM
028c0213 THE FED PROPERLY SHIFTED ITS EMPHASIS TO AVERT A BREAKDOWN IN THE PAYMENTS SYSTEM ASSOCIATED WITH SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

028c021b ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
028c021c HUMAN RIGHTS TOO MAY HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD IF MR. GORBACHEV LIVES UP TO HIS PROMISE TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS BY YEAR'S END
028c021d IF TEXACO MANAGERS WANT TO BE THERE IN THE FUTURE IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO BOOST STOCK SAYS AN INFLUENTIAL TEXACO HOLDER
028c021e OTHERWISE HE SAYS WHEN THEIR ELECTION COMES ROUND YOU COULD GET A BIG SWING IN THE VOTE IF MR. ICAHN DECIDES TO RENEW THE FIGHT

029c0201 THE COMPANY AND MR. TRUMP ARE CURRENTLY BATTLING IN COURT
029c0202 AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED MR. TRUMP IS SEEKING TO PREVENT BALLY FROM BUYING GOLDEN NUGGET INCORPORATED'S CASINO HOTEL IN ATLANTIC CITY N. J.
029c0203 THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION BY BALLY IS WIDELY PERCEIVED AS AN EFFORT TO SCUTTLE A TAKEOVER ATTEMPT BY MR. TRUMP
029c0204 ALL INDICATIONS SUGGEST THOUGH THAT THE REAGAN NAKASONE SUMMIT WILL NOT BE ABOUT MONETARY POLICIES
029c0205 THEY WILL DISCUSS TRADE ISSUES WHICH ARE CERTAINLY IMPORTANT BUT RATHER REMOTE FROM THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM
029c0206 ALL OF THE WORLD'S EXPORTS AND IMPORTS COME TO ABOUT TWO TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR
029c0207 BUT FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET TRADING AMOUNTS TO ABOUT ONE TRILLION DOLLARS A WEEK
029c0208 IT IS THE FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT THE BATTLE OF THE DOLLAR WILL HAVE TO BE FOUGHT
029c0209 INVESTORS RANGING FROM U. S. CORPORATIONS TO JAPANESE BUYERS OF U. S. TREASURY BILLS MUST FACTOR IN A RISK PREMIUM FOR DOLLAR VALIDITY
029c020a THUS IT IS AT LEAST PLAUSIBLE IF NOT LIKELY THAT DOLLAR VALIDITY IS ONE REASON REAL INTEREST RATES HAVE STAYED HIGH IN THE U. S.
029c020b IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT NO PLAN TO RESTORE STABILITY TO WORLD MARKETS CAN SUCCEED WITHOUT ADDRESSING DOLLAR VALIDITY
029c020c THERE IS A GROWING MIDDLE CLASS OF COLOMBIANS WHO HAVE WORKED THEIR WAY UP AND ARE NOW BUYING THEIR OWN HOMES AND IMPROVING THEIR STANDARDS OF LIVING
029c020d THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE STABILITY OF THE ECONOMY ABHOR VIOLENCE AND ARE USUALLY PRO U. S.
029c020e FURTHER THE HOSPITALITY AND KINDNESS OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE ARE SUPERB
029c020f I FOUND THIS TO BE TRUE NOT JUST IN THE MAJOR CITIES BUT ALSO IN AREAS THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT CONSIDERED RISKY
029c020g THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF EXAMPLES
029c020h GROWING LIFE EXPECTANCY THREATENS TO BANKRUPT SOCIAL SECURITY BUT THE COMPROMISE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE DID LITTLE MORE THAN BURDEN WORKERS BY RAISING THE PAYROLL TAX
029c020i THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO PILE UP GREAT DEFICITS BUT THE BUDGET SUMMIT COMPROMISE OF LAST AUTUMN HARDLY CUTS ANYTHING AT ALL
029c020j SOVIET INFLUENCE IN NICARAGUA THREATENS U. S. SECURITY BUT THE U. S. HOUSE ENGAGES IN A PITCHED BATTLE OVER EVEN SCRAPS OF MILITARY HARDWARE TO THE CONTRAS
029c020k I THINK THE MARKET JUMPED THE GUN ON THE NOTION OF A WEAK ECONOMY AND THE FED EASING MR. FINE SAID
029c020l SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS A CONSOLIDATION
029c020m HE EXPECTS LONG TERM TREASURY BOND YIELDS TO HOVER AROUND THE EIGHT AND ONE HALF PERCENT LEVEL IN THE NEAR FUTURE
029c020n THE STANDOFF CASTS DOUBTS ABOUT HOW SINCERE JAPANESE COMPANIES ARE IN THEIR STATED WILLINGNESS TO BUY MORE U. S. MADE CHIPS
029c020o IT ALSO COULD STYMIE A NEW NEGOTIATING APPROACH IN WHICH THE INDUSTRIES NOT THE GOVERNMENTS IRON OUT TRADE DISPUTES
029c020p THAT COULD DRIVE AMERICAN CHIP MAKERS TO ASK THE U. S. GOVERNMENT FOR MORE PUNITIVE MEASURES AGAINST JAPAN
029c020q DURING ANY REPAIR PROCESS BLOOD CLOTS ARE CONSTANTLY BEING FORMED AND DISSOLVED
029c020r IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE SCIENTISTS SPECULATE THAT DURING ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR THE ARTERY WALL THE BODY AT SOME POINT TRIES TO DISSOLVE A BLOOD CLOT
029c020s BUT IT MISTAKENLY GRABS PROTEIN INSTEAD OF PLASMINOGEN PULLING IT WITH ITS BAG OF FAT AND CHOLESTEROL INTO THE ARTERY WALL
029c020t THIS THWARTS THE REPAIR PROCESS AND BEGINS A VICIOUS CYCLE DRAWING MORE AND MORE CHOLESTEROL INTO THE DAMAGED AREA
029c020u AND IN FACT MICROSCOPIC BLOOD CLOTS AND BITS OF LP ARE FOUND IN THE MISHMASH OF THE DEPOSITS
029c020v IF THE SETTLEMENT IS COMPLETED THE COMPANY WOULD JOIN SHAREHOLDER PLAINTIFFS IN SEEKING DAMAGES AGAINST FOUNDER EDDIE ANTAR AND OTHERS
029c020w CRAZY EDDIE CURRENTLY IS A DEFENDANT IN THE HOLDERS' LITIGATION
029c020x THE NEW MANAGEMENT HAS ACCUSED MR. ANTAR IN COURT AND REGULATORY FILINGS OF ENGAGING IN A POSSIBLE SCHEME TO FALSIFY INVENTORY AND PROFIT REPORTS
029c020y AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT CABLE OWNERS WILL RESIST THE CHANGE
029c020z A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONAL CABLE TELEVISION ASSOCIATION SAID WE DON'T OPPOSE THE PROPOSAL IN PRINCIPLE
029c0210 WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE MORE PEOPLE IN THE CABLE MARKET THE BETTER
029c0211 THE SALE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS NOT WIDELY EXPECTED
029c0212 BUT DESPITE THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE THE NEWS HAD LITTLE NET EFFECT ON THE SECONDARY MARKET FOR NEW YORK BONDS
029c0213 THERE ISN'T ENOUGH SUPPLY FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE SIZABLE OFFERING TO HAVE MUCH IMPACT EXPLAINED ONE TRADER
029c0214 BUT EASTERN EXCLUDED A NUMBER OF HIGH TRAFFIC HUB CITIES FROM THE SPECIAL PROGRAM WHICH INVOLVES TRAVEL FROM SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH TO DECEMBER FIFTEENTH
029c0215 FOR INSTANCE CHICAGO WHERE UNITED HAS NUMEROUS DEPARTURES AND ATLANTA WHERE DELTA HAS SEVERAL WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE PROGRAM
029c0216 IN ADDITION TICKETS MUST BE PURCHASED FROM AUGUST FIFTEENTH TO AUGUST TWENTY SIXTH
029c0217 SCIENTISTS IN GENERAL MUST COME TO TERMS WITH THEIR RELIANCE ON CONGRESS FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT
029c0218 SPACE SCIENTISTS NOW COMPETE FOR ATTENTION WITH OTHER BIG SCIENCE PROJECTS SUCH AS MAPPING THE HUMAN GENOME OR THE SUPER COLLIDER
029c0219 IN THE PROCESS ALREADY ESTABLISHED SCIENTISTS IN BASIC RESEARCH FEEL SLIGHTED
029c021a WITNESS THE RECENT DISPUTE OVER CONTINUING N. I. H.'S ARTIFICIAL HEART PROGRAM
029c021b SOCIALIST REVOLUTION THE CARDS READ

029c021e CONSUMERS MAY ALSO BE WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER AUTO MAKERS WILL CONTINUE THE GENEROUS INCENTIVES THEY'VE USED ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY OVER THE PAST YEAR TO BUOY SALES

20fc0107 THE PATIENT POOL MIGHT SHRINK BUT THE COMPANY COULD GRAB A BIGGER PART OF IT
20fc0108 IN JULY AND AUGUST U. S. G. OFFERED EARLY RETIREMENT INCENTIVES THAT RESULTED IN THE ELIMINATION OF MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MOSTLY SALARIED POSITIONS

20fc010k THERE ARE STILL LEGISLATIVE ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND AMONG FOUR HOUSE COMMITTEES BEFORE THE BILL REACHES THE HOUSE FLOOR

409c0202 THAT WAS UP FROM FRIDAY'S AVERAGE OF SIX POINT TWO TWO PERCENT
409c0203 THE INCREASE CAME EVEN THOUGH THE FEDERAL RESERVE INJECTED FUNDS INTO THE BANKING SYSTEM BY BUYING SECURITIES FROM DEALERS WHO AGREED TO BUY THEM BACK NEXT MONDAY
409c0204 WHAT TRIGGERED G. M.'S NEW STRATEGY ISN'T CLEAR
409c0205 WHILE G. M. APPARENTLY HAS DECIDED THAT ITS INCREASINGLY GENEROUS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS HAD GOTTEN PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE CUTTING PRODUCTION IS COSTLY TOO
409c0206 THE HIGH FIXED COSTS OF IDLE FACILITIES SURELY WILL DEPRESS G. M.'S FIRST QUARTER PROFIT

40ec020f BUT TRADERS ASSERTED THAT MUCH OF THE LATE ACTIVITY CAME FROM PROFESSIONALS
40ec020g A CONVENTION WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO A WHOLE NEW GROUP OF LEADERS
40ec020h AN ELECTION TO CHOOSE CONVENTION DELEGATES WOULD BE LIKE A SPECIAL ELECTION TO PICK A NEW CONGRESS
40ec020i UNDER LEGISLATION PASSED BY THE SENATE A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION WOULD BE MADE UP OF ONE MEMBER ELECTED FROM EACH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT AND TWO AT LARGE FROM EACH STATE
40ec020j NO CURRENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS COULD PARTICIPATE
40ec020k ALTHOUGH AIRLINES DENY HANDLING COMPLAINTS DIFFERENTLY THEY MAKE NO APOLOGIES ABOUT FAVORING FREQUENT FLIERS IN OTHER WAYS
40ec020l THEY SAY THEY ARE ONLY TRYING TO BOOST MEMBERSHIP IN THESE PROGRAMS WHICH AIRLINES CONSIDER CRUCIAL FOR DEVELOPING BRAND LOYALTY
40ec020m THESE ARE OUR MOST IMPORTANT CUSTOMERS SAYS A UNITED SPOKESMAN
40ec020n ASKED ABOUT A NEW PRESIDENTIAL AID REQUEST JIM WRIGHT TALKED ABOUT MORALITY
40ec020o IF I SCHEDULE IT THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE SOME MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP PASS IT HE SAID
40ec020p I DON'T WANT TO RUN IT OUT THERE AND BE DEFEATED AGAIN
40ec020q MR. WRIGHT SHOULD BE LESS TIMID IN HIS CONVICTIONS
40ec020r AFTER ALL HE ISN'T THE ONE WHO HAS TO RISK GETTING HIT OVER THE HEAD WITH A METAL PIPE
40ec020s MR. MAUCHER SAID HE HAD DISCUSSED SOME FORM OF STRATEGIC COOPERATION WITH ROWNTREE'S MR. DIXON FOR THE PAST YEAR
40ec020t MR. MAUCHER DECLINED TO ELABORATE EXCEPT TO SAY HIS PROPOSALS FELL SHORT OF A TAKEOVER BID
40ec020u HE SAID HE UNSUCCESSFULLY RAISED THE POSSIBILITY OF COOPERATION AGAIN WITH MR. DIXON AFTER THE JACOBS SUCHARD RAID TWO WEEKS AGO
40ec020v AT THAT POINT NESTLE DECIDED TO LAUNCH ITS BID MR. MAUCHER SAID
40ec020w LORENZO THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT HAS CLEARLY IMPACTED OUR TRAFFIC LEVELS AT BOTH COMPANIES PARTICULARLY IN THE EAST WHERE OUR OPPONENTS HAVE GENERATED A LOUDER NOISE LEVEL
40ec020x WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL ONLY BE TEMPORARY
40ec020y BUT NEVERTHELESS IT WILL HAVE A FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANY
40ec020z THE COMPANIES EARLIER THIS MONTH AGREED ON A PROPOSAL FOR WARNER TO ACQUIRE LORIMAR FOR ABOUT SIX HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN STOCK
40ec0210 LORIMAR CULVER CITY CALIFORNIA PRODUCES TELEVISION SHOWS
40ec0211 WARNER NEW YORK IS AN ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY WITH INTERESTS IN MOVIES TELEVISION RECORDED MUSIC AND CABLE TELEVISION
40ec0212 THINGS ARE A BIT DULLER THIS YEAR
40ec0213 MR. BILZERIAN HAS SENT HIS BOY TO A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM IN FARAWAY MINNESOTA WHERE THE FAMILY SPENDS ITS SUMMERS AND ISN'T COACHING A TEAM THIS YEAR
40ec0214 ALL THE ACTION APPARENTLY WILL BE IN THE COURTROOM
40ec0215 MR. BETHELL HAS AN EYE FOR THE FASHIONABLE AND FOR THE ABOMINABLE WHICH TODAY ARE OFTEN THE SAME THING
40ec0216 HE OBVIOUSLY RELISHES A GOOD FIGHT AND SAYING NO TO THE CULTURAL BARBARIANS AND THE CURRENT WISDOM
40ec0217 HE USES PIG BLADDER HAMMER AND TONGS AND SCALPEL AND HE IS ADEPT WITH THEM ALL AS THE ELECTRIC WINDMILL SHOWS
40ec0218 MOST ECONOMISTS IN THE U. S. SEE THE U. S. TRADE DEFICIT ALSO SHRINKING
40ec0219 THAT SHOULD HELP JAPAN
40ec021a BUT JAPANESE FEAR THAT EMOTIONS AIRED IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WILL BE BAD NEWS FOR THEM WHOEVER WINS
40ec021b LISTENING TO DEMOCRAT MICHAEL DUKAKIS IS JUST LIKE SEEING THE GHOST OF U. S.
40ec021c REPRESENTATIVE RICHARD GEPHARDT SAYS A RECENT EDITORIAL IN THE SANKEI SHIMBUN A POPULAR JAPANESE NEWSPAPER REFERRING TO THE CANDIDATE WHO SUPPORTED PROTECTIONISM IN THE PRIMARIES
40ec021d BUT THE PAPER ADDS THE LIKELIHOOD OF A BUSH VICTORY DOESN'T MEAN WE WILL BE SAFE
40ec021e INDEED THE NEW U. S. TRADE BILL GIVES THE WHITE HOUSE LESS ROOM TO SIDESTEP PUNISHING JAPAN FOR TRADE VIOLATIONS
40ec021f C. F. T. C. OFFICIALS WILL BE GRILLED SEPTEMBER EIGHTH WHEN THEY PRESENT THEIR PRELIMINARY FINDINGS TO THE SENATE AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE

40fa0114 THEY ESTABLISHED ROYAL COMMISSIONS TO RECOVER ILLEGALLY HELD CHURCH LANDS
40fc0201 WHILE HE BELIEVES THE DOLLAR WILL MOVE LOWER AGAINST THE MAJOR CURRENCIES THE SOFTENING EXPORT MARKET IS PRESSURING JAPANESE AND EUROPEAN EXPORTERS
40fc0202 THAT OF COURSE IS LIMITING THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THESE COMPANY STOCKS
40fc0203 THESE STOCKS HAVE GONE UP TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THE PRICE EARNINGS MULTIPLE IS MUCH HIGHER ABROAD THAN HERE
40fc0204 THAT WOULD MAKE NON DOLLAR EQUITY INVESTMENT LESS ATTRACTIVE
40fc0205 DESPITE THEIR GRUMBLING AND THE LONG ODDS OPPOSITION POLITICIANS ARE REMAINING IN THE CAMPAIGN
40fc0206 SOME EVEN ARE TRYING TO IMPROVE THEIR CHANCES BY COMBINING FORCES
40fc0207 THE SMALL LABOR AND LIBERAL PARTIES HAVE ALLIED WITH THE MOSLEM BROTHERHOOD AN ISLAMIC POLITICAL ORGANIZATION THAT IS LEGALLY BARRED FROM FORMING A PARTY OF ITS OWN
40fc0208 COMDATA SHARES CLOSED YESTERDAY AT SIXTEEN POINT THREE SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS UP ONE POINT SIX TWO FIVE DOLLARS IN COMPOSITE TRADING ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE

40fc020b MR. KAGLER WOULD BURST OUT OF HIS OFFICE COMMENTING SARCASTICALLY TO SECRETARIES ABOUT COLLEAGUES HE CONSIDERED SLOW MOVING INCLUDING MR. EVERINGHAM
40fc020c AT FIRST WHAT HE DID WAS STRATEGIC TO PROD EVERINGHAM SAYS ONE OFFICIAL FAMILIAR WITH THE SITUATION
40fc020d LATER IT WAS FROM SHEER FRUSTRATION
40fc020e AT MOST HIGHFLYING TEXAS THRIFTS A FRIEND OF THE BOSS COULD GET MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON A SIGNATURE
40fc020f LOANS COULD EXCEED THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE LAND THANKS TO SOME LIBERAL TEXAS S. AND L. LAWS AND COOPERATIVE APPRAISERS

40fc020k UNDER BANKRUPTCY LAW TEXACO ALONE CURRENTLY HAS THE RIGHT TO PROPOSE A REORGANIZATION PLAN FOR ITSELF
40fc020l THAT RIGHT EXPIRES NEXT MONTH BUT TEXACO HAS ASKED JUDGE SCHWARTZBERG TO BLOCK PROPOSALS FROM ANY OTHER PARTIES UNTIL MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
40fc020m THE PENNZOIL SPOKESMAN SAID THE REORGANIZATION PLAN TO BE OUTLINED TODAY WOULD BE PRESENTED AS PART OF A MOTION OPPOSING TEXACO'S REQUEST FOR MORE TIME
40fc020n BOND TRADERS ALSO WERE CHEERED BY ANOTHER DROP IN OIL FUTURES PRICES THE SEVENTH DECLINE IN THE PAST EIGHT SESSIONS
40fc020o THE DROP HAS INDICATED TO SOME ANALYSTS THAT INFLATION FEARS WERE GREATLY EXAGGERATED
40fc020p PREVIOUSLY OIL PRICES HAD SURGED ABOVE TWENTY TWO DOLLARS A BARREL LARGELY ON FEAR THAT GROWING TENSION IN THE PERSIAN GULF MIGHT LEAD TO A DISRUPTION OF OIL SUPPLIES
40fc020q IF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION IS COMPLETED COCA COLA WILL BE LEFT WITH HUGE BORROWING CAPACITY
40fc020r COCA COLA SAID ITS PRO FORMA DEBT WOULD BE REDUCED TO ABOUT NINE PERCENT OF TOTAL CAPITAL
40fc020s THE COMPANY'S DEBT WAS TWENTY SIX PERCENT OF CAPITAL AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER ITS TARGET RATIO IS THIRTY FIVE PERCENT
40fc020t HOWEVER THE LONG SIEGE OF CORPORATE COST CUTTING HAS ALREADY SLASHED CORPORATE PAYROLLS SO SEVERELY THAT MANY COMPANIES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THEIR BREAK EVEN LEVELS OF OPERATIONS
40fc020u IN EFFECT THEY ALREADY ARE OPERATING AS IF IN A RECESSION SO LAYOFFS MIGHT PROVE RELATIVELY MODEST
40fc020v IN ADDITION THE ROLE OF MANUFACTURING IN THE ECONOMY HAS FADED IN COMPARISON WITH THE GROWTH OF RECESSION RESISTANT SERVICE JOBS
40fc020w BURGER KING U. S. A. PILLSBURY'S BIGGEST SINGLE BUSINESS ALSO REMAINS ITS LARGEST PROBLEM
40fc020x DESPITE A MANAGEMENT SHAKE UP AND AN EXPENSIVE NEW ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN FRANCHISEES REPORT DISAPPOINTING SALES
40fc020y LET'S JUST SAY IT'S NOT A ROARING SUCCESS SAID ONE WEST COAST FRANCHISEE OF THE WE DO IT LIKE YOU'D DO IT PROMOTIONAL THEME
40fc020z A SUCCESSFUL AD CAMPAIGN WILL DRIVE SALES AND WE DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING
40fc0210 A PILLSBURY SPOKESMAN SAID BURGER KING SALES IN THE FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER HAVE BEEN FLAT
40fc0211 IN THE COMMITTEE HEARING MR. SEIDMAN HAD BEEN ASKED WHETHER ANY OTHER U. S. BANKS ARE EXPECTED TO FAIL IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS
40fc0212 WE DO NOT SEE ANY MAJOR BANKS BEYOND MAYBE ONE OR PERHAPS TWO THAT WE MIGHT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HE SAID
40fc0213 HE ADDED THAT HE COULDN'T IDENTIFY ANY MAJOR FAILURE CANDIDATES FOR SURE
40fc0214 LOST WAGES SOME ECONOMISTS ARE DISMAYED AT THE LABOR DEPARTMENT'S PLANS TO DROP THE HOURLY EARNINGS INDEX FROM ITS MONTHLY EMPLOYMENT REPORT NEXT YEAR
40fc0215 IT'S A FASHIONABLE NUMBER SAID MR. CHANDROSS OF LLOYD'S BANK NEW YORK
40fc0216 ECONOMISTS ARE CURRENTLY FOCUSING ON THE INDEX TO GET A READING ON WAGE INFLATION
40fc0217 THE LABOR DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO REPORT MONTHLY AGGREGATE DATA ON AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS
40fc0218 BUT THE INDEX IS BEING REPLACED BY THE EMPLOYMENT COST SERIES
40fc0219 ECONOMISTS SAID THE NEW INDEX HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING A MORE RELIABLE READING AND THE DISADVANTAGE OF COMING OUT ONLY ONCE A QUARTER RATHER THAN EVERY MONTH
40fc021a HIGHER COMMISSIONS CAN ALSO REDUCE THE INVESTMENT VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES THAT INCLUDE A SAVINGS COMPONENT SUCH AS UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICIES
40fc021b IN GENERAL POLICIES WITH HIGHER COMMISSIONS HAVE LOWER SURRENDER VALUES
40fc021c THAT'S WHAT POLICYHOLDERS GET IF THEY CASH IN THE POLICY OR WHAT THEY CAN BORROW THROUGH POLICY LOANS

40gc0201 FOR THE NON RUSSIANS THE PROBLEM IS FAR MORE COMPLEX THAN JUST PRESSURE TO GIVE UP THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGES
40gc0202 ANOTHER DIFFICULTY IS THE DISTORTION OF THEIR NATIONAL HISTORY
40gc0203 SOVIET HISTORY BOOKS AND SCHOOL BOOKS USUALLY MAKE IT SEEM AS IF THE VERY PURPOSE OF THESE NATIONS' EXISTENCE IS TO FIND HAPPINESS AND FULFILLMENT IN THE ARMS OF RUSSIA
40gc0204 AS ONE UKRAINIAN WRITER PUT IT THE LOSS OF NATIONAL MEMORY TODAY HAS BECOME ESPECIALLY ACUTE ALARMING

40gc020l THE ADMINISTRATION'S SIX YEAR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT POLICY DESIGNED TO COAX PRETORIA TOWARD DISMANTLING APARTHEID DIDN'T SUCCEED
40gc020m AND SANCTIONS IN THE SHORT RUN WON'T DAMAGE SOUTH AFRICA'S SELF RELIANT ECONOMY

40gc0218 THE FALL WAS LED BY BANK STOCKS
40gc0219 OTHER INDUSTRIAL SECTORS HOWEVER RECOVERED FROM RECENT DECLINES
40gc021a STILL THE NEURAL NETWORK REPRESENTS A REMARKABLE CONCEPTUAL LEAP IN THE COMPUTER WORLD
40gc021b IT IS A CRITICAL BUILDING BLOCK IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MUCH AS THE NEURONS IN HUMANS ARE THE VEHICLE FOR BRAIN FUNCTION

40hc0206 THIS SEEMS TO MAKE THEM FEEL LATINO ALTHOUGH A MEXICAN WOULD NO MORE PUT LIME JUICE IN A CORONA THAN A FRENCHMAN WOULD PUT PEANUT BUTTER ON A CROISSANT
40hc0207 MEXICANS ONLY PUT THE JUICE OF A LIME LIKE FRUIT IN CANNED BEER
40hc0208 THE FED MAY HAVE EXPECTED US TO DROP THE PLAN GIVEN ITS CONDITIONS SAYS MR. KOMATSU

40oc020j CONGRESS LEFT NO ROOM FOR THE COMMISSION WHEN OPERATING WITHIN THIS SPHERE TO USE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS
40oc020k ALSO PROVIDING SOME SOLACE FOR MUNICIPAL BOND PROFESSIONALS IS THE FACT THAT COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE BECOMING MORE ACTIVE AS UNDERWRITERS RATHER THAN AS INVESTORS

40oc0210 THE CUOMO PLAN DOESN'T STOP AT GOUGING NEW YORK TAXPAYERS AND LONG ISLAND RATEPAYERS
40oc0211 FEDERAL TAXPAYERS ALSO WILL CONTRIBUTE
40oc0212 THE KEY TO THE DEAL IS THAT LILCO ALSO WOULD GET A TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR TAX WRITE OFF FOR SHOREHAM
40oc0213 THIS WOULD GUARANTEE THAT THE UTILITY WON'T HAVE TO PAY ANY FEDERAL TAXES FOR AT LEAST A DECADE
40oc0214 NEW YORK ALSO WOULD HELP LILCO FLOAT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX EXEMPT INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BONDS TO HELP PAY FOR THE CLEANUP

40oc0218 YET WE PROBABLY HAVE THE LARGEST MANUFACTURING CONSULTING PRACTICE IN THE WORLD
40oc0219 THE REASON FOR THE RELATIVELY MODEST INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IS THAT THE AUTO MAKERS ARE DEMONSTRATING A MUCH BETTER ABILITY TO KEEP PRODUCTION IN LINE WITH SALES
